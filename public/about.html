<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hey there! I'm Leo and I do engineering. I started out as a Civil Engineer (coding in MATLAB and alike), turned into a technical project manager
  but ended up finding my passion in development. I enjoy designing all kinds of things and solving technical 
  problems. they just scratch that itch you know?  
</p>

<p>
  I spend my spare time writing music, taking film photos and painting. I simply enjoy life and hope to always keep moving forward. I like taking care of my plastic plants and I really want
  to adopt a cat in the near future
</p>

<p>
I speak five languages almost fluently, includig German, Italian, Russian and Georgian. This comes in handy as I can communicate with most of the people I come across in my life.
